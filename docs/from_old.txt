# world-gen

World fantasy generation project that runs in the browser.

It aims to be a single resource to generate a simulated (as best it can) planet with towns and maybe more.

Planet TODO  :
	Vizual
x		draw cells
x		draw contours
		draw lines
x		draw arrows
		draw symbols
		draw topology layers

	Cells
x		manual add/remove
~		dynamic add/remove cells
x		compute voronoi

	Tectonic plates
x		set N similar plates
		set N plates with varying sizes
		group plates
x			basic - close to cenetr
			complex - weighted graph
x		translate plates
		rotate plates
~		dynamic add/remove cells to plates
			Convergent
			Divergent
			Transform

	Relief
		tectonic plates interactions
			Convergent
			Divergent
			Transform
		hotspots
		rifts

	Fluids
		specify water/ocean cells
		air currents
			just flow vector
			transports data
		water currents
			just flow vector
			transports data

	Space
		axial tilt
		anual sun heating per cell

	Planet data
		earthkuake points
		make temperature ranges
		make binomes
		make rivers

City TODO :

	Planet
		pick optimal spots

	Terrain
		get planet data in that spot
		make more detailed locally
