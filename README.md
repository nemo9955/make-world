## Features and priorities

    ✅ Robust framework with workers for paralelisation
    ✅ Complex event system for use with workers
    ✅ GUI to interact with the tool
    ✅ DB to hold information locally
    ✔️ Linearly (re)generate world : Planet Sys -> Terrain -> Region -> Town
    ✔️ Dedicated Pages to experiment with/generate single world parts like Planet Sys, Terrain, Towns, Languages, etc.
    🌑 Proper Save, Select & Load of worlds from local DB

    🌐 Planetary system - functionally implemented
        ✔️ Realistic-ish formulas and rules for a few usable elements (Planets and Starts)
        ✔️ Complex structures like single/binary Start and single/multi Planets with 0/1/2+ Moons
        🌑 More complex generation with more Orbital Elements

    🌐 Planet terrain - Basic implementation
        ✔️ Store and smoothly draw up to 100k points (target is 500k)
        ✔️ Static terrain with graph algos. to generate different elements like rivers
        🌑 Moving Tectonic plates for more complex terrain

    🌐 Languages - Basic demo implementation
        🐞 Experiemnet with a few existing names/words generating libs
        ✔️ Make a custom way of generating names/words by passing text and extracting probabilities
        ✔️ Script to exctract category data from Wikipedia to feed the names/words generator

    🌍 Building/rooms - Basic demo implementation
        🌍 Based on imput text, assemble the layout of a building room by room
        🌓 Implement some automatic generation of rooms
        🌓 Generate some outside mesh based on rooms
        🌓 Add furniture and architecture to rooms

    🌓 Interaction between elements
        🌓 Heating of the Planets from the Star(s)
        🌑 Tidal forces
        🌑 Air and watter currents

    🌔 Regional terrain - better resolution, more proeminent features in a restricted zone
    🌓 Macro city and roads - Planet location of citys/towns and connecting roads/routes
    🌑 Micro citys/towns - basic layout with streets and buildings
    🌑 Building details - floors and layout
